#ideas for usnpsc (from easiest to hardest)
1. make it guess a part name in second message and string search within commodity name of pdf, then make it pick one
2. embed and fuzzy search names
3. iteratice hieararchical guessing (lazy quick version would send the whole image every time tough it might get expensive)
4. assistant API analysis (may be not stable and seems less expensive)
